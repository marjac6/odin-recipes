# odin-recipes

Project to contain and manage culinary recipes

This is the first project that will be done as a part of odin-project curriculum. The main goal of it is to practice HTML -> CSS -> JavaScript.

After the initial phase of development which is learing, project will most likely be developed further making it usable as some kind of community site to share recipes and add comments on the makes.
